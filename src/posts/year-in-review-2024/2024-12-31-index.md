<p class="lead">2024 was in many ways a very challenging year for me, but it was also one of the most significant.<p>

This year's annual review post is a bit different.

In previous years, I reflected on the work that I did, the web projects I built, the posts that I wrote and so on. There was lots of that in 2024 too of course (well maybe except the blogging part, that seems to [become a pattern](https://front-end.social/@matuzo/113729399287780395)).

But the truth is, most of my energy this year went towards building a life for our new family.

My son was born in November, and he's happily sleeping on my chest as I am typing this. I've never felt more grateful or proud about anything in my life, and I still can't believe he's with us now.

The months leading up to his arrival were quite stressful at times, supporting my wife's pregnancy and preparing everything as best I could for the steps ahead. We're planning a move next year, and there's still lots of work to do before we can settle into our new home.

But all of it is very rewarding, and I can't wait to see where 2025 takes us. Despite everything that's going wrong in the world right now, I feel hopeful for the future.
